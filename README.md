D&D 5th edition site<br/>

Description<br/>

I want to build a D&D search database using the D&D api. Essentially where you can search everything about a class/attack/monster and pull the relevant information from the api. This way during games you can quickly reference the site to find out an attack or what a spell does. Stretch goal would be a character/monster save/favorites, where you can grab different monsters/attacks or classes and compare them to each other. To help a dungeon master keep tabs on enemies or characters with spells. As well as a dice page so you can roll a random number in case someone forgot a die of some kind.<br/>
